These games code are extremely outdated in comparison to JS player code, so they may not work at all with the current version of JS player.

Since actual major-priority vector of development is maximum compatibility with the Editor, games may be updated to the new player code only after the level of acceptable compatibility will be reached. Sorry for any inconvenience.
