// Resource manager
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// .subscribe() allows to subscribe to any number of urls and to execute a callback (or few) when
//              there is a known status for each one of them (received or failed);
//              callback receives an array of results of length equal to the given urls array
//              and with null in place of urls which were failed to receive, and it receives total
//              failure count;
//
// .loadOrGet() should be called for every remote resource Resource Manager should be aware of;
//              it receives a loader function that actually should request for that resource in any way
//              it wants to (async or not), but should call provided success handler in case of success
//              or error handler in case of failure; `subject_id` should be the same as for corresponding
//              subscribe group (it's the only way we currently found to ensure to unsubscribe loaders
//              from single subject, instead of all, in case of cancel);
//
// .check() is the internal function that iterates through all subscriptions, checks the status
//          of the urls and calls the subscribed callbacks in case if their resources are ready;
//          it is called by Resource Manager itself in cases when there was a chance that some resource
//          changed status;
//
// .trigger() notifies Resource Manager about the fact that resource located at given URL was successfully
//            received and provides it the received value; may be called from outside; forces .check() call;
//
// .error() notifies Resource Manager about the fact that resource expected to be located at some URL
//          was failed to be received and provides it the error object as a cause of the failure;
//          may be called from outside; forces .check() call;
//
// .has() checks if the resource with given URL is stored in Resource Manager's cache (was received before);
//
// .clear() clears all the subscriptions from this subject;

// The system designed with intention (but not restricted to it) that any player will first subscribe (using its ID)
// to all remote resources from current animation, then trigger them to load with multiple .loadOrGet() calls (with passing
// the same ID). In .loadOrGet() it should call .trigger() or .error() for a resource in appropriate case.
// If player needs to stop loading remote resources (i.e. if animation was accidentally changed when it
// already started but nor finished loading them, or if it was required to be detached at some point in-between),
// it should call .cancel() with its ID.
// NB: Notice, that no check is performed just after subscription! Because if new player instance will request resource
//     which is in cache thanks to previous instance, its own loader (.loadOrGet()) will not be called!

// FIXME: loader in .loadOrGet() should call trigger() and error() instead of notifiers
// FIXME: get rid of subject_id in .loadOrGet(), it requires to pass player or animation everywhere inside
//        (may be in favor of subscriptions groups and generating ID automatically inside)
//        the main pitfall here is that sheet.load or audio.load requires player as an argument
