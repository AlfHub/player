An URL for the snapshot without the parameters may look like:

**`http://animatron-snapshots.s3.amazonaws.com/3f68b131-8a6a-4e0f-82f8-99a2576ab9d9`**

Then, an URL with all parameters specified may look like:

**`http://animatron-snapshots.s3.amazonaws.com/3f68b131-8a6a-4e0f-82f8-99a2576ab9d9?w=600&h=500&bg=f0fff0&m=0&r=0&z=1&t=25&p=37&debug=0`**

Any of the parameters is optional, here is a definition for each of those:

* **w** is forced width and **h** is forced height of the player, so even if any scene loaded inside the player has another size, player won't be resized to fit it (as by default), but will be forced to scale scene to this size, and add black ribbons if aspect ratio is not the same; however, if player is placed inside of `iframe`, `iframe` size will have major priority above this size.
* **bg** is the background color of the player in format of **`ff00a6`**; if you don't specify this background, player background is treated as transparent; this color, however, can't contain alpha value, only solid fill; when scene has it's own background (may contain alpha) and there is a player background specified, they are applied in order of: player background below, then scene background;
* **m** mode of the player, `PREVIEW` (no controls, no handling mouse/kb) is `0`, `DYNAMIC` (no controls, handling mouse/kb) is `4`, `VIDEO` (controls are shown, no mouse/kb handling, default) is `11`. *NB: These values are subject to change in near future*.
* **r** specifies the repeating mode, `1` is to repeat (*loop*), `0` (*default*) â€” play once.
* **z** is zoom of the scene, may be a float value
* **t** is time to start play from when scene is loaded (by default player is stopped in this case, waiting for user to press *play* control), specified in centiseconds, so `t=370` means "play from 3s 700ms"
* **p** is time to pause at when scene is loaded (by default player is stopped at time of 0 in this case, waiting for user to press *play* control), specified in centiseconds, so `p=370` means "pause at 3s 700ms"
* **debug** flag (`0` or `1`, *off* by default) allows to turn on debug information such as FPS and exact time.
